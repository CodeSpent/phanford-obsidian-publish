## Obsidian Publish


The purpose of this plugin is to give myself a means of publishing content from my Obsidian notebook to phanford.dev via a Git submodule.

All content is maintained as markdown so Obsidian acts as editor with deliberate pushes to the submodule triggering a build of phanford.dev after initializing content 
submodule.
